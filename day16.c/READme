The menu is displayed with fixed items and prices.

The program asks how many customers are ordering.

For each customer, it records the item number and quantity, calculates their total bill, and adds it to the café’s total.

After all customers are served, it shows the day’s total revenue, total items sold, and which items were most and least popular.
